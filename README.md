## About the Project

CryptoStore is an intuitive invoicing system that allows users to:
- Input and manage client details such as name, address, and email.
- Select products from a predefined list with dynamic quantity and pricing adjustments.
- View a summary of selected products, including subtotals and totals with tax calculations.
- Save invoices for future reference.

The application is designed to simplify the invoicing process while maintaining flexibility and scalability.

## How It Works
1. **Header Section:** Enter client details including identification number, name, and email.
2. **Product Selection:** Choose products from a dropdown, specify the quantity, and add them to the summary.
3. **Summary Section:** View all added products with their respective totals and remove items if needed.
4. **Invoice Details:** Automatically calculates subtotals, tax (IVA), and total amounts.
5. **Save Invoice:** Store the invoice data locally for future reference.

The entire process is streamlined to ensure a smooth user experience while maintaining accurate data management.
